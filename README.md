# le-yolo
The code for TVC 2025 paper "A Lightweight Enhanced YOLOv8 Algorithm for Detecting Small Objects in UAV Aerial Photography"
This is an improved model based on YOLOv8 for target detection from the perspective of drones

## CODE：
you can get the official  YOLOv8 code at https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics
,get the pruning code at https://github.com/VainF/Torch-Pruning

and then add our improvement code to the project.

We have released all the improved code, and the code in project format is still being organized.
