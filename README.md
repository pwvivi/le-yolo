# le-yolo
This is an improved model based on YOLOv8 for target detection from the perspective of drones

## CODE：
you can get the official  YOLOv8 code at https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics
,get the pruning code at https://github.com/VainF/Torch-Pruning

and then add our improvement code to the project.

Our improvement code is currently being organized and will be released after the paper is accepted

## DATASETS：
